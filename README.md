# Alarm-Clock-App
It's basically supposed to be a clone of the http://onlineclock.net/, made so that I can get a better grasp of HTML, CSS and JS/JQuery. A 'clone' more than a straight clone though. I'm planning on making a few changes, like totally omitting all the 'fun' clocks. Not linking to the nonsensical FB page every time the alarm reaches the set time. Somewhat modifying the color-schemes of the page when you change them with the top-right links and so on. Really depends on what I end up thinking of to change in the end. It should, fundamentally, remain the same site though. The changes won't end up being TOO large, I think.
